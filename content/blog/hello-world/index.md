Hello, dear reader, and welcome to my corner of the internet!

In this blog, I primarily talk about the ever-evolving landscape of software engineering and technology. I talk about interesting things that I come across during my day job, not just to share them with the world, but also as resources that I can look back to in the future. I also talk about my journey as a Software Engineer, and frankly, anything else that interests me.
